# First Responder Vocabulary

During incidents that involved first responders, it is critical for incident
commanders to understand the collection of people that are at the incident site,
as well as their skills and training, in order to deploy the right people, to
the right places, at the right time.

This specification is useful for describing First Responders using Verifiable
Credentials in a way that is compatible with NIEMOpen, a community-driven,
common vocabulary that enables efficient information exchange across diverse
public and private organizations. Verifiable credentials being issued using this
technology can be utilized by incident commanders to quickly and accurately
determine the capabilities of their responders as well as vet, in real time, the
veracity of their qualifications.
